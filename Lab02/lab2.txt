 Question:
  If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to
build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?
- In Java, it allows some method with the same name but the parameters' type of them must be different and can be distinguished. So in this case, Java don't allow to create two constructor method because 'title' and 'category' have the same type "String".
